# inforce
I wanted to called it ~~re~~**inforce** but then I learned that such a name is reserved for an algorithm so it would be too boring (not much more insteresting now)

### Prerequisites

Listed in requirements.txt
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
That's it

### Installing

Install the [prerequisites](#Prerequisites)
```
git clone https://github.com/ivan23kor/inforce.git
cd inforce
```

To generate some data:
`python test.py --help` or `./test` (after a careful reading of the parameters)

To generate some plots:
`python plot.py`
(after tweaking plot.py)
